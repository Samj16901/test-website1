        <h2>What Causes the Northern Lights?</h2>
        <p>The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are caused by collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun and particles in Earth's atmosphere. These collisions release energy in the form of light, which we see as colorful auroras.</p>

        <h2>The Science of Solar Winds</h2>
        <p>Solar winds, streams of charged particles from the sun, interact with Earth's magnetic field, directing particles toward the poles. This phenomenon results in the stunning displays of the auroras.</p>

      <div class="column">
        <h2>Colors of the Aurora</h2>
        <p>The colors of the aurora depend on the type of gas particles involved. Oxygen produces green and red auroras, while nitrogen results in blue and purple hues.</p>

      <h2>Factors Influencing Auroral Activity</h2>
      <p>Several factors influence the intensity and visibility of auroras:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solar Cycle:</strong> The sun has an 11-year cycle that affects aurora intensity. During solar maximum, auroras are more frequent and vivid.</li>
        <li><strong>Geomagnetic Storms:</strong> Caused by disturbances in Earth's magnetic field, geomagnetic storms can amplify auroras.</li>
        <li><strong>Earth's Magnetic Field:</strong> The shape and strength of Earth's magnetic field funnel particles toward the polar regions, creating auroras.</li>
      </ul>
