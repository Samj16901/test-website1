        <h2>Tips for Viewing the Northern Lights</h2>
        <p>Here are some useful tips to help increase your chances of witnessing the aurora borealis:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check the Weather:</strong> Clear skies are essential. Cloud cover can easily obscure the aurora, so make sure to check local weather conditions before heading out.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid Light Pollution:</strong> Find a location away from city lights. Rural and remote areas offer the best viewing opportunities.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay Warm:</strong> The best viewing occurs during winter months, so dress warmly in multiple layers. Thermal clothing, hats, and gloves are a must!</li>
          <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> The Northern Lights are a natural phenomenon, and they don't run on a schedule. Plan to spend several hours outside for the best chance of seeing them.</li>
        </ul>
